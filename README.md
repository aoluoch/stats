📘 Assignment: Database Design, Normalization & Data Analysis with Pandas
👩‍🎓 Overview

This assignment is divided into two main parts:

Database Design & Normalization – understanding how to structure databases efficiently.

Data Analysis with Pandas – using Python’s Pandas library to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data.

The goal is to strengthen both database design concepts and practical data analysis skills.

🎯 Learning Objectives

🛠️ Understand principles of good database design and normalization.

💡 Apply 1NF, 2NF, 3NF to remove redundancy and improve data efficiency.

📊 Use Pandas for data manipulation, exploration, and analysis.

🔍 Gain hands-on experience with missing data handling, merging datasets, and visualization.

📂 Part 1: Database Design & Normalization
🔑 Key Topics

Entities, attributes, and relationships.

First, Second, and Third Normal Forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF).

Removing redundancy and ensuring data integrity.

📝 Task

Design a database for a real-world system (e.g., school, hospital, e-commerce).

Show how you apply normalization steps (from raw data → 1NF → 2NF → 3NF).

📂 Part 2: Data Analysis with Pandas
🔑 Key Topics

Importing and exploring data.

Handling missing values.

Summarizing and describing datasets.

Merging/joining multiple DataFrames.

Visualization with Seaborn/Matplotlib.

📝 Task

Work with a sample dataset using Pandas.

Perform:

df.info() → to check structure.

df.describe() → to summarize numeric values.

isnull().sum() → to detect missing values.

pd.merge() → to combine datasets.

Create at least one visualization using Seaborn.
